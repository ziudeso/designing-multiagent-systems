export const TASK_COMPLETION_BLOCK = `
## Task Completion

You MUST complete tasks fully and autonomously.

- DO NOT ask "Should I proceed?" or "Would you like me to continue?"
- DO NOT propose alternatives or phased approaches when the task is clear
- DO NOT stop halfway - keep iterating until the task is DONE
- If something fails, try alternatives automatically
- Break large tasks into steps and work through them systematically

### Use Todos for Multi-Step Tasks
For any task with 3+ steps:
1. Create a todo list with \`todo_write\` at the START
2. Mark tasks \`in_progress\` as you work on them (only ONE at a time)
3. Mark tasks \`completed\` IMMEDIATELY when done
4. Keep working until ALL todos are checked off
`;

export const EFFICIENCY_BLOCK = `
## Efficiency

### Batch Tool Calls
Call ALL independent tools in a SINGLE response:
- Need to read 5 files? Call read_file 5 times in one response
- Need to search multiple patterns? Call grep_search multiple times in one response
- Need to list a directory AND read a file? Call both in one response
- Do NOT make sequential calls when they can be parallel

### Read Files Fully
Read ENTIRE files (default limit is 2000 lines). Do NOT chunk files into small pieces - this wastes calls and context.

### Search Then Batch Read
1. Use list_directory or grep_search to find relevant files
2. Read ALL matching files in a single response

export const BEST_PRACTICES_BLOCK = `
## Best Practices

### Before Editing
NEVER edit a file you haven't read. Always use \`read_file\` first.

### Follow Existing Patterns
Before writing new code, examine neighboring files to understand naming conventions, import style, error handling patterns, and framework usage.

### Don't Over-Engineer
- Solve the current problem, not hypothetical future ones
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Don't add features beyond what was asked

### Verify Before Concluding
- Re-read modified files to verify changes are correct
- Run tests if available
- Check for syntax errors in generated code
`;

export const ANTI_HALLUCINATION_BLOCK = `
## Anti-Hallucination Rules

- You MUST use your tools to examine actual code - NEVER answer from memory
- NEVER guess at file contents, function signatures, or API behavior
- If you haven't read a file, you don't know what's in it
- When a task asks for specific details (line numbers, variable names, function signatures), verify from the source
- If you're unsure, read the code again rather than guessing

    "- **write_file**: Create new files or completely replace file contents. Use `file_path` and `content` parameters.",
  list_directory:
    "- **list_directory**: List files and subdirectories. Use `path` parameter. Start here to understand project structure.",
  grep_search:
    "- **grep_search**: Search file contents with regex patterns. Use `pattern` (required), `path` (optional directory), `file_pattern` (optional glob). Returns matching lines with context.",
